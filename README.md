ScoreKeeper is a lightweight score keeping program that allows users to create competitive events and share those events with friends.  Users can create an account to add their own scores to multiple events and check the scoreboard to see where they place and how other people they know are doing in the event.

The first version of the program is focused on golf, but can easily be expanded to almost any competitive event.

Developed by Caleb Cook, Josh Hilliard, LaShundra Davis, Mariya Powers, and Monica Villa Ghoston with assistance by Jess Rosinski.
Developed as a LaunchCode 2023 Web-Dev final project.
